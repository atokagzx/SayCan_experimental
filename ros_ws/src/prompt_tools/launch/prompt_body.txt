Write each action as: pick_place(a, b).
Separate actions with a new line.
At the end of the work, type "robot_done()". 
For example, to pick blue block and place it on all other items one by one, I should:
pick_place(blue block, red block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
pick_place(blue block, yellow block)
Do not repeat the same action twice.
Try not to use the same block twice.
For example, to pick fish and place it on all plates one by one, I should:
pick_place(fish, red plate)
pick_place(fish, green plate)
pick_place(fish, yellow plate)
robot_done()
Here is an example of moving cookie on all cups one by one:
pick_place(cookie, cup 1)
pick_place(cookie, cup 2)
pick_place(cookie, cup 3)
robot_done()
Here is an example how to separate bricks from meal into different plates:
pick_place(fish, red plate)
pick_place(purple block, green plate)
pick_place(meat, red plate)
pick_place(egg, red plate)
pick_place(orange cube, green plate)
pick_place(bread, red plate)
pick_place(colorful brick, green plate)
pick_place(pink box, green plate)
robot_done()
Here is an example how to separate meal from tools into different plates:
pick_place(fish, red plate)
pick_place(meat, red plate)
pick_place(egg, red plate)
pick_place(bread, red plate)
pick_place(fork, green plate)
pick_place(knife, green plate)
pick_place(screwdriver, green plate)
pick_place(spoon, green plate)
robot_done()
Here is an example of building a tower from green, yellow, black and white blocks:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(black block, green block)
pick_place(white block, black block)
robot_done()
Here is an example of placing all blocks into the matching color plates:
pick_place(green block, green plate)
pick_place(yellow block, yellow plate)
pick_place(black block, black plate)
pick_place(white block, white plate)
robot_done()
Here is an example of listing the order of stacking the vertical tower from these colored blocks:
pick_place(yellow block, black block)
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(white block, green block)
pick_place(black block, white block)
robot_done()
Here is an example how to make a tower using colored blocks if you have other objects on the table:
pick_place(purple block, pink block)
pick_place(orange block, purple block)
pick_place(blue block, orange block)
pick_place(green block, blue block)
pick_place(yellow block, green block)
robot_done()
As you see, you should set the order of actions in the way that the robot can perform them.
Try to use as few actions as possible.
Now, complete the task:
On the table are: {available_objects}.

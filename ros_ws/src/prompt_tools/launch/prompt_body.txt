Write each action as: pick_place(a, b).
Separate actions with a new line.
At the end of the work, type "robot_all_actions_done()". 
Do not repeat the same action twice.
Try not to use the same block twice.
Brick, block, cube, square are the same objects in this context.
Red block, green block, yellow block, blue block are colored blocks.
Here are some examles with explanations:
On the table are: fish, green block, yellow block, blue block, red block, green plate, yellow plate, blue plate.
For example, to pick blue block and place it on all other items one by one:
pick_place(blue block, red block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
pick_place(blue block, yellow block)
pick_place(blue block, yellow plate)
pick_place(blue block, green plate)
pick_place(blue block, blue plate)
For example, to pick fish and place it on all plates one by one:
pick_place(fish, red plate)
pick_place(fish, green plate)
pick_place(fish, yellow plate)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example how to separate blocks from fish into different plates:
pick_place(green block, green plate)
pick_place(yellow block, green plate)
pick_place(fish, yellow plate)
pick_place(blue block, green plate)
pick_place(red block, green plate)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example of building a tower from green, yellow and blue blocks:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example of placing all blocks into the matching color plates:
pick_place(green block, green plate)
pick_place(yellow block, yellow plate)
pick_place(blue block, blue plate)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example of listing the order of stacking the vertical tower from these colored blocks ending with the red block on top:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
pick_place(red block, blue block)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example how to make a tower of two blocks:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example how to make a tower of three blocks:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example how to build a tower using green, yellow and blue blocks:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example how to set cubes in matching color plates:
pick_place(green block, green plate)
pick_place(yellow block, yellow plate)
pick_place(blue block, blue plate)
robot_all_actions_done()
Here is an example of making a tower of colored cubes:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
pick_place(red block, blue block)
robot_all_actions_done()
As you see, you should set the order of actions in the way that the robot can perform them.
Try to use as few actions as possible.
Now, complete the task:
On the table are: {available_objects}.
Task is:

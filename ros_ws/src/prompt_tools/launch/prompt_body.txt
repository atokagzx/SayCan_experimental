Write each action as: pick_place(a, b).
Separate actions with a new line.
Do not repeat the same action twice.
Try not to use the same block twice.
At the end of the work, type "end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)". 
For example, to put blue block on all blocks in turn, I should:
pick_place(blue block, red block)
pick_place(blue block, green block)
pick_place(blue block, yellow block)
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)

Here is an example of assembling a tower from blocks:
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(black block, green block)
pick_place(white block, black block)
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
Here is an example of placing all blocks into the matching or appropriate color plates:
pick_place(green block, green plate)
pick_place(yellow block, yellow plate)
pick_place(black block, black plate)
pick_place(white block, white plate)
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
Here is an example of listing the order of stacking the vertical tower from these colored blocks:
pick_place(yellow block, black block)
pick_place(green block, yellow block)
pick_place(white block, green block)
pick_place(black block, white block)
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
Here is an example how to make a tower using colored blocks if you have other objects on the table:
pick_place(purple block, pink block)
pick_place(orange block, purple block)
pick_place(blue block, orange block)
pick_place(green block, blue block)
pick_place(yellow block, green block)
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
To execute task: place fish on plate, you should write:

# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
Here is an example of how to place fork on plate:
pick_place(fork, plate)
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
For example, arrange the blocks into plates of the appropriate color, you should:

# don't take red block, as there is no red plate
# and now task completed, sending signal to stop execution
end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)
As you see, you should set the order of actions in the way that the robot can perform them.
At the end of the work, type "end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)".
If you want to stop actions, write "end_of_action_list(stop, don't touch fish, forever)".
Try to use as few actions as possible.
